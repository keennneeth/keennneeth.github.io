							<h2>General Features</h2>
							</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Include the general information in your sketch: personalized calendar, news feed, text messages, social feed items, clock, and weather.							</h2>
									<p><FONT COLOR=white>

								<br>Below is my sketch that will represent a smart mirror. The time will always be on the mirror
								unless you click on News, You will have options to check the weather in your area,
							 a personalized calendar filled with that days tasks, news feed to keep up with the news
							while you get ready, and also your twitter feed that shows whats trending.</br> 
						<h2>Health Features</h2>
					</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time.
					</h2>
					<p><FONT COLOR=white>

						</br>There will also be a section
						for your health, this will include how much sleep you got, a random exercise to do for the day, and also a scale. The sleep timer will
					go off of your phone alarm and the time you fall asleep, it will subtract that from the alarm and tell you how many hours you have slept
				throughout the night. The scale feature will work by having a scale below the mirror and it will store that information on the mirror, it will update
			everytime you step on the scale and keep track of your weight for one week.</p>
					</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Provide the Sketch of your interface</br>

								<h2><FONT COLOR=red>B</h2>
							<h2>Below is the sketch in p5.js</h2>
								</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Implement your Sketch in Processing or p5.js</h2>


								</br><FONT COLOR=white></br>The image is a little blurry due to me having to zoom in on my web browser, this does not
									affect how it works though.

							<h2>General Information </h2>
							</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Implement the general information : personalized calendar (from a csv or json file), news feed (from a csv or json file), current clock, and local weather (from a file or api).

							</h2>
									<p><FONT COLOR=white>
							<p>The General information can be found on the left side of the mirror, this includes a personalized calender,
								news feed from a news network, and Local weather. Time will always be displayed unless the news app opens up because it will
								take up most of the screen. The only difference from my sketch and the one implemented in p5 was that there was no messages
								button and the layout was a little different but it has the same functionality. 
								 </p>
								 <h2>Health Information</h2>
								</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Implement the health-related information in your sketch (select one of these): sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time (from a csv or json file).
								</h2>
																	<p><FONT COLOR=white>

								 <p>When you click on the brain it will bring up three different options,
									sleep, weight, and exercise. The user can click on those 3 and it will bring up the information
									of the user for that option. </p>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/SketchP51.png"	width="600" height="800"  alt="" data-position="top center" /></a>
<p>The top one is the weight, hence the scale, when the user clicks on it, it will present the users weight
	if they have a compatible scale in front of the mirror. If the user does not have a compatible one they could simply type
their weight themselves and keep track. The middle one with the weight will give you an exercise to do for the day, this can be randomized. This will also be able to keep track of the amount of
steps you have taken for the day. The last option is the one for sleep, the user will have to connect their phone to the mirror and set an alarm, the user could wear a device that detects when they fall asleep,
this will connect to the mirror, it can either be stopped by an alarm or when the device detects the user wake up. It will then keep track of their sleep,
light sleep or deep sleep, also how much you have slept everyday for the week. </p>

							<h2><FONT COLOR=red>A</h2>
							</br><FONT COLOR=blue>Implement one of the advanced features</h2>
								<p><FONT COLOR=white>

							</br>The advanced feature in my smart mirror is the ability to also be a light source 
							The user can select the light button and it will cycle through colors, once the user wants that color they
							can just leave it and it will function as a light, by clicking the light button again it will turn off the light feature.<br>

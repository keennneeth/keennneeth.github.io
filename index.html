							<h1>Smart Mirror</h1>
							<p><FONT COLOR=white>In the mirror that I have made I was able to implement a clock depending on your location, along with temperature.</br>
							<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/elvgif.gif" alt=" " /></a>
							<div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:center;">
								<h2><FONT COLOR=red>B</h2>
							<h2>Think about the common things that you use in an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?</h2>
								<p><FONT COLOR=white>The most common things that I use in an elevator is clicking the floor level and then the close button. This interface makes it doable, but it makes you think for a second
									if you have never been on that elevator before.
								</p>


							<h2> How it works, Common Sequence, Feedback & Common Mistakes
							</h2>
							<p>Users will know how an elevator works, this interface has the numbers in bold and you just click on it. 
								Many elevators will have the same functions, click a floor and it will do the rest. This elevator and most of them will highlight the 
								floor number button red and it will let the user know it worked. <br>
								Some common mistakes that people will make with this design is going to the rear doors instead of the front door or 
								clicking the open door button and opening the wrong side.</p>

							<h2> Solution and New Design</h2>
							<br>
							<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/sketch.jpg" alt="" class ="rotate90"/></a>
							
							<br>
							<h2><FONT COLOR=red>A</h2>

							<p><FONT COLOR=white>Simple yet effective, the new design will include a screen that will display floor level at the top of the door.
								The control panel will consist of 5 buttons and a screen that will display destination level.
								User will use up and down button to choose floor level and hit green button to go to desired floor.
							<h2> Design </h2>
							<p>The reason for this is because it will allow for a clean interface and it will be easy to comprehend, using the up and down arrows
								will allow the user to pick a desired floor, after a couple seconds of being on that number the door will automatically close
								or they can click the green button to speed up the process. This will eliminate the close door button, depending on how
								tall the building is, it will eliminate a set amount of buttons.

									<h2> Design Options </h2>
									<p>
										This can be made with a touch screen if desired, or just simple buttons, both will have the same functions but one will look modern. 
										The screen will be about 8" tall and 14" wide, The reason for this is because the screen doesnt have to be large in order to fit 
										5 buttons and a number. The feedback for this will be a speaker announcing "Going Up", or "Going down",
										depending on what the user selects. Like the previous design, the buttons will also light up red allowing the user
										to know that it has been pressed.
										<h2><FONT COLOR=red>E</h2>

										<h2>Disabilities & Extras</h2>
										<p><FONT COLOR=white>· People with disabilities will be able to use the elevator, making it bigger than a normal elevator you can comfortably fit someone
										on a wheel chair. Also by adding brail to the buttons on the non touch screen, it will allow blind people to use it.
										<br>										
										<br>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/LargeElv.jpg" alt="" data-position="top center" /></a>
										<br>· An information screen can be brought up by clicking a series of buttons that will display the maintence info and anything important that can be needed.

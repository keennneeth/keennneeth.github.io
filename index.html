							<h1>Issues and Design</h1>
							<p>There are a couple of bad options used in this elevator. One being the rear doors, to keep it simple it should just open one way, or have both doors open
								at the same time. Having double of everything makes it very cluttered, double numbers and double door open/close.
								Overall it is not the worst design invented, after looking at it for a couple seconds you can understand it.</br>

							<div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:center;">
							

							<h2> Every Day Use</h2>
								<p>People will typically use elevators in order to avoid stairs in very tall buildings, some rare times i'd use an elevator is 
								maybe moving large objects and I don't want to walk up the stairs. This interface makes it very practical since you just click 
								a button and it will bring you up.</p>


							<h2> Feedback </h2>
							<p>Many elevators will have the same functions, click a floor and it will do the rest. This elevator will provide feedback by 
							highlighting the floor in red, that's when the user will know that it has been activated.</p>
							

							<h2> Common Mistakes</h2>
							<p>One very common mistake that people will make with this design is opening the rear doors instead of the front door or 
							clicking the open door button and opening the wrong side.

					<!-- Second Imagine-->

								<div class="inner">
									<h2>Solution</h2>
									<p>Simple yet effective, the new design will include a screen that will display floor level at the top of the door.
										<br>The control panel will consist of 6 buttons and a screen that will display destination level.
										<br>User will use up and down button to choose floor level and hit green button to go to desired floor.
